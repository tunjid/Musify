/**
 * A [GreetingPhraseGenerator] that uses [TimeBasedGreetingPhraseGenerator]
 * under the hood by passing [LocalTime.now] to its constructor. This class
 * was mainly created because default constructor parameters causes an exception
 * when injecting. A constructor with default arguments will generate two constructors
 * in java that are annotated with [Inject]. This will cause ambiguity for the hilt
 * annotation processor. In order to circumvent this, inject this class instead of
 * directly using [TimeBasedGreetingPhraseGenerator]. If the logic of that class
 * is to be tested, use that class by passing the time to be tested directly in its
 * constructor.
